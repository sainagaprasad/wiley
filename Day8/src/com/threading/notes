Multi Threading
it can be achieved by
1.runnable interface
2.thread class

life cycle of thread
	1.thread is instantiated : new thread()
	2.putting the thread into ready pool : start() -> this is where the stack of the thread is created
	3.thread starts executing : run() -> invoked by jvm
										 behavior is controlled by operating system
	4.thread pauses/blocks itself so that the other threads gets a chance to execute
	5.sleep(),wait(),wait(time),i/o blocking,delay : methods used to stop or pause the thread
	6.notify(),notifyall() : resume the thread
	7.terminating the thread

Interview Questions
1. relation between start and run
2. how to use runnable explicitly
3. 

priority of threads:
0-lowest
11/10/9/8 : highest
it can also have enum rated values : min,max,norm priorities

yeild: give processing to other thread of equal priority than the currently executing thread.if there is none current one continues

these are not thread methods these are object methods
wait(); wait(time);
notify(); :-> notifying the blocked connected threads
notify all(); :-> notifying all the connected blocked threads
